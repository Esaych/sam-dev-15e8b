I am a Software Development Engineer and in my free time an artist. I am originally from the Washington DC area and now am based in Seattle.

My interest in code started in 5th grade, back in 2009. Starting in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), to programming TI-84 games,
to building Java based [Minecraft server plugins](https://github.com/Esaych/DDCustomPlugin) by the 9th grade.
I was hired for my first software development internship with E-PAGA Inc. after my freshman year of high school. I worked with E-PAGA
and was happy to gain industry experience and contribute to impactful solutions until graduating college and leaving the company in 2019.

I graduated from the University of Maryland in 2019 with a degree in Computer Science and a concentration in art.
In 2019, I was hired as a software engineer at Amazon.com and relocated to Seattle, WA.

Now living in the PNW, I frequently am hiking, biking, snowboarding, trying new Seattle foods,
and always seeking a new view of a colorful evening's sunset.

As a hobby, I love to tinker with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis to find home solutions and create art projects.
I also have skills in 3D printing, woodworking, and playing piano by ear.

My dream job is to work in a visually creative field of software development. Ideally, one which involves art
displays, human-computer interaction or visual effects driven by electronics and programmed software.
