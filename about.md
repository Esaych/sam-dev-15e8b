I am a Software Development Engineer, and in my free time an artist. I am originally from the DMV area, and now based in the Seattle area.

My interests in code started in 5th grade, 2009. Starting in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), to programming TI-84 games, 
to building Java based [Minecraft server plugins](https://github.com/Esaych/DDCustomPlugin) by the 9th grade. 
I was hired for my first software development internship with E-PAGA Inc. after my freshman year of high school. I worked with E-PAGA 
and was happy to gain industry experience and impactful solutions all the way until graduating college and leaving the company in 2019.

I graduated from the University of Maryland in 2019 with a degree in Computer Science and a concentration in art. 
In 2019, I was hired as a software engineer at Amazon.com and relocated to Seattle, WA.

Now living in the PNW, I frequently am hiking, biking, snowboarding, trying new Seattle foods,
and always seeking a new view of an evening sunset.

As a hobby, I love to tinker with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis to find home solutions and create art projects. 
I also have skills in 3D printing, wood working, and can play the piano pretty decently.

My dream job is to work in a visually creative field of software development. Ideally one which involves art
displays, human computer interaction or visual effects driven by electronics and programmed software.
