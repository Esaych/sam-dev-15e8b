I had successfully completed creating an [electronic wood sculpture](https://sam.holmberg.dev/posts/neopixel-wood-sculpture/) and making my house a Raspberry Pi wifi synced sound system (post tbd), so it was time to integrate the two into this sculpture.

This post will be about how I got my lights to visualize with the music in my house. But before we start, here's a video of the finished result!
